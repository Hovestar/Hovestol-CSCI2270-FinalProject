--Project Summary--
The genetic algorithm seg faulted before it even entered main, so 
I'm now going to run a program that finds the average time for a train 
to run around a track and pick up 4 carriages from each depot and then 
return them to home base. Based on 
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/railroad-train/id431485490?mt=8 
It has interested me for a while to see what causes advantages and 
disadvantages in the game for an individual train.

--How to Run--
Compile Graph and main.cpp with g++
then ./a.out to run
If you'd like to change the path you can upload a new graph by hand and 
then recompile.


--Dependencies--
None

--System Requirements--
Works on Linux, should work on anything else also.

--Group Members--
Just me. (Seth Hovestol)

--Open issues/bugs/future--
Multiple trains
This is simplifed:
-Occasional 2 cars
-Always drops off before pick up
-doesn't compete with other trains or run into itself
